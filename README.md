The images from PSD file were used for icons, therefore, the hover, visited, focus effects weren't created since it wasn't possible to change the color of image. The mostly changes were applied in CSS file where the three media queries were created for screen sizes mentioned in PSD file and the changes are related for positioning of elements. In the HTML file, the <meta tag> was added for responsive design and ajax script as well for JS functionalities. The JS functionalities were created for search on click, toggle menu for mobile devices and 'back to top' arrow which can be seen in the file.
